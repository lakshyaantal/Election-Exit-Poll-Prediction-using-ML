# Election-Exit-Poll-Prediction-using-ML

•	Performed EDA and feature engineering (encoding, scaling) on election survey data (1525 voters, 9 variables), ensuring clean input for modeling.
•	Built and compared multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), optimizing hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
•	Achieved highest model performance with Gradient Boosting: Training Accuracy: 87%, Test Accuracy: 83%, Train AUC: 93%, Precision: 89% (train), 86% (test) | Recall: 93% (train), 90% (test) 
•	Ensured model robustness by validating with confusion matrices, ROC-AUC curves, and checking for no overfitting (aligned train-test results).
•	Delivered an optimized prediction model for accurately forecasting voter preferences to support exit poll analysis and seat prediction.
